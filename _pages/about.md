I am a Senior Research Scientist (Post-doc) in Speech Technology and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at Quality and Usability Lab, [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu-berlin.de/) (TUB). I have recently received my Ph.D. from TUB under the Supervision of Prof. [Sebastian Möller](https://www.qu.tu-berlin.de/menue/team/professur/) from the Department of [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://www.eecs.tu-berlin.de/menue/fakultaet_iv/parameter/en). During my Ph.D., I have focused on integrating social speaker characteristics such as warmth and competence into artificial speech generation mechanisms. I have a great interest in system building from scratch. As a part of my Ph.D. project, I have worked on speech data collection, interpretation of speech perceptions by humans in HCI, understanding the relationship between acoustic correlates and speech perceptions, and manipulation of acoustic correlates for positive perceptions of artificially generated speech in HCI. Prior to this, I graduated with my master's from the International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad (IIIT-H). My Master's was mainly focused on developing approaches for Cross-lingual Voice Conversion to enable human-like code-switched speech generation.
